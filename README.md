view the old original alpha at: http://monitorplannerbeta.atwebpages.com/ (for legacy)


# Small Planned Features:

tooltips for necessary things,

reorganize options, add more stat outputs, 

make bezzel width an option and reflect it in the monitor border width,

add more set-up analysis stats, 

fix inconsistencies with "detect from custom resolution" and "custom" radio buttons, 

change some of the radio button options to select combo boxes instead (still to be pondered),

depreciate the need for retrieving theta values (aspect ratio) from the html and just rely on the calculations from the resolution input (alomst there in the js)



# BIG GOALS:

prebuilt setups from dropdown menu for inspiration, 

Make the Monitors Draggable so that it will be possible to stack them vertically

have better support for mixing english and metric units,

optimize better for mobile
