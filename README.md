# Small Planned Features:

tooltips for necessary things,

reorganize options, maybe add more stat outputs, 

add more set-up analysis stuff, 

fix inconsistencies with "detect from custom resolution" and "custom" radio buttons, 

change some of the radio button options to select combo boxes instead (still to be pondered),

depreciate the need for retrieving theta values (aspect ratio) from the html and just rely on the calculations from the resolution input (alomst there in the js)

make the javascript look more pretty. (sort and better document, and moar whitespace)



# BIG GOALS:

rewrite the html files in PHP, 

prebuilt setups from dropdown menu for inspiration, 

somehow rebuild it to support stacking monitors vertically to see how they fit (big maybe, probably not by OP),

have better support for mixing english and metric units
