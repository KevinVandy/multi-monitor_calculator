# Planned Features
SMALL GOALS:
tooltips for necessary things,

reorganize options, maybe add more stat output, 

add more set-up analysis stuff, 

fix inconsistencies with "detect from custom resolution" and "custom" radio buttons, 

change some of the radio button options to select combo boxes instead (still to be pondered),


BIG GOALS:
rewrite the html files in PHP, 

prebuilt setups from dropdown menu for inspiration, 

somehow rebuild it to support stacking monitors vertically to see how they fit (big maybe, probably not by OP),
